		<h1><FONT COLOR="ORANGE">HEARING MASS BEFORE AND AFTER PANDEMIC</FONT></h1>
		<p>The Pandemic that hits the world affects the different aspects of our lives. Before the pandemic, people could go outside, go to different places, socialize to different groups of people, attend school and attend mass. In the 1st quarter of 2020, everything changed because of the Covid-19 virus that spread faster, and killed many people. To protect ourselves and others, there are preventive measures, our government implemented. Preventive measures include physical or social distancing, quarantines, ventilation of indoor spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, using of face masks and face shield.<FONT COLOR="ORANGE"></FONT>. <FONT COLOR="ORANGE"></FONT></p>
		<p>There are differences in my personal experience before and after the pandemic. In attending a Liturgical Mass during Pandemic, the church only allows 30% of the seating capacity. You cannot enter the church without face masks and a face shield. Also, there are some church personnel who check your temperature before entering the church, alcohol spraying is also done by them. Some churches also are inspecting if one person has a vaccination card indicating that they are fully vaccinated. For those vulnerable to getting a virus and still not having a vaccine or incomplete, there are alternative ways of attending a Liturgical Mass through Virtual Mass that can be seen in FB Lives and YouTube Lives. This technology really helps our society to still do the normal things we do before pandemic.<FONT COLOR="ORANGE"></FONT>. <FONT COLOR="ORANGE"></FONT></p>
		<p>As of March of the year 2022, Metro Manila and other provinces are under Alert Level 1. Under Alert Level 1, there are still restrictions in terms of indoor activities. I noticed that 70% capacity is allowed in church as long as physical distancing is still observed. Face shields are not a requirement anymore but face masks are still a must. Luckily, NCR administered a big percentage in vaccination. Most of the people living in the city are fully vaccinated. We donâ€™t want another breakdown that will affect us in our daily lives, especially activities that we are doing outside.<FONT COLOR="ORANGE"></FONT>. <FONT COLOR="ORANGE"></FONT></p>
		<p>In terms of the Order of Mass, I can say that it is the same order as before and after the pandemic, there are Introductory rites that includes Penitential Act and the Gloria, The Liturgy of the Word that includes First Reading, Psalm, Second Reading, Gospel, The Homily and The Creed, The Liturgy of the Eucharist, Communion Rights and the concluding rites. Both are still done before and after the Pandemic.<FONT COLOR="ORANGE"></FONT>. <FONT COLOR="ORANGE"></FONT></p>
		<p>I believe that even though there are just a few differences in the way we are attending the Liturgical Mass before and after pandemic. It is a different feeling if we attended and visited the house of Christ differently. The Blessings of the priest using the Holy Water, the smells of incense, the interactions, and the feelings are a way different compared when you are attending mass using technology. I also believe if the pandemic will end other church activities especially these lent seasons, will be exercise. Attending mass is the central act of worship of the Roman Catholic Church. We celebrate it. No matter the hindrances the world is facing right now, we must pray that soon everything will be normal again and that no Pandemic will stop us from believing and worshiping God.<FONT COLOR="ORANGE"></FONT>. <FONT COLOR="ORANGE"></FONT></p>
